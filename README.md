# Topic: Hearing_Aid_Accessibility
Analysis on the accessibility of OTC hearing-aids on Costco.  

# Communication
  1. Determined Jacqueline would be the organizer of group zoom meetings and calls.
  2. Zoom meetings occuring every 2 days or more to stay organized, work through road blocks and set next steps
  3. Agreed to meeting every Tuesday & Thursday at office hours through class time (unless emergency occurs)

# Github
  1. Branch made for each member

# Machine Learning
  1. Mocked up structured and unstructured notebooks to run 2 - 3 models for best fit
  2. Discussed what we are trying or could potential predict with our data. 
  3. Will run Logistic Regression, RandomForest and K-means for feature selection/PCA to determine:
     Where Costco does not have a Hearing Center and should have a location.  
?     a. Training on: costco locations?  Binary output on yes / no costco in zip?
  4. Precision and recall may be better determinates to for a good model rather than accuracy.
  5. May need to add additional data if ML doesn't work with initial data.  Such as:
     a. price of OTC hearing aids in locations with a Costco vs areas without a Costco Or 
        price of OTC hearing aids at Costco vs Competitors
     b. increasing the zip codes "with" a Costco to those zip codes in a 10 mile radius of a Costco
     
# Database
  1. Agreed upon using AWS S3 data repository for shared use of project files.  Easy to share work and connect to multiple 
     
     a. combined data table(s)
     b. project notebooks
