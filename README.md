# Topic
"Costcoâ€™s hearing aid centers have been one of the biggest success stories in the hearing aid industry over the past decade. According to a 2017 report from Bernstein Research, sales at Costco hearing centers have grown at approximately 20% per year since 2011, with Costco expected to account for 19% of all units sold in the U.S. retail market by 2021." - (https://www.hearingtracker.com/hearing-aids/costco)

# Question
## How does the need for over-the-counter hearing aids affect Costco?
This analysis is to demonstrate how Costco can impact and increase accessibility for over-the-counter hearing aids. 

## Communication
![Zoom](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106329824/198689305-eaff54cd-e6a1-408b-a853-ab3342e8430e.jpg)


* 6:30pm - 9:30pm Tuesday & Thursday to meet deadlines, work through roadblocks and create new goals
* 1 hour additional Zoom meetings occuring 5 times a week for maintaining workflow
* Daily group updates using slack
* Assigning roles, research, and tasks as new needs and requirements arise

# Technologies Used

## Data Sourcing and Selection
Each teammate spent a full day researching data to contribute towards analysis.

Data chosen: 
* ESRI 2019 Census Demographics
* ESRI 2021 ACS
* Costco Locations - Kaggle

Data considered: 
* NIDCD Data


## Data Cleaning and Analysis
The cleaning and analyzing of the data included:
* Dropping irrelevant columns
* Creating consistency in label names
* Locating Costco hearing clinics
* Merging demographic data 

Using Pandas, a Python library, data that started as census data was transformed to csv files allowing for quick and simple analysis.
